            Think about the stories you
            read in a newspaper: for each
            story, there will be a headline,
            some text, and possibly some
            images. If the article is a long
            piece, there may be subheadings
            that split the story into separate
            sections or quotes from those
            involved. Structure helps readers
            understand the stories in the
            newspaper.

            The structure is very similar
            when a news story is viewed
            online (although it may also
            feature audio or video). This is
            illustrated on the right with a
            copy of a newspaper alongside
            the corresponding article on its
            website.

            Now think about a very different
            type of document â€” an
            insurance form. Insurance forms
            often have headings for different
            sections, and each section
            contains a list of questions with
            areas for you to fill in details or
            checkboxes to tick. Again, the
            structure is very similar online.
