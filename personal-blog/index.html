  Hi, I'm Paulina ðŸ‘‹

  I'm on a journey to become a front-end web developer. 
  I love building little projects, trying out new coding 
  techniques, and sharing what I learn along the way. When 
  I'm not at my desk, you'll find me reading, hiking through 
  the mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing walls.

  I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself 
  accountable, and hopefully inspire anyone else who's learning 
  to code. Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks 
  for stopping by!
